MySQL Capstone Project 1
Retail Analytics Database

1) Database Design
This project is a Retail Management System built using MySQL. It manages the complete flow of a retail business — customers, products, orders, payments, and deliveries — using 6 tables:
•	customers — stores customer name, city, state, gender, and membership type
•	products — stores product name, category, and price
•	orders — stores order date and status for each customer
•	order_items — stores individual products and quantities within each order
•	payments — stores payment mode, status, and amount for each order
•	deliveries — stores delivery partner, status, and city for each order

2) Table Relationships
•	customers → orders — One customer can place many orders (One-to-Many)
•	orders → order_items — One order can have many products (One-to-Many)
•	products → order_items — One product can appear in many orders (One-to-Many)
•	orders → payments — One order has one payment (One-to-One)
•	orders → deliveries — One order has one delivery (One-to-One)

3) Key Insights from Reports
•	Chennai has the most customers (4 out of 10)
•	iPhone 15 Pro is the highest priced product at ₹89,999
•	UPI is the most preferred payment method
•	7 out of 15 orders were successfully delivered
•	2 failed payments need follow-up for revenue recovery
•	Customers like Arjun, Priya, and Karthik placed multiple orders showing strong loyalty
•	Cancelled orders were flagged and matched with returned deliveries

4) Summary
This Retail Management System covers the complete retail workflow using 6 well connected tables. The project includes over 50 SQL queries covering filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and data quality checks — making it a complete and practical database project.
